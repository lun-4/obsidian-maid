# Obsidian Maid

[voidmap](https://github.com/void-rs/void) but on Obsidian instead.

## How to use

```sh
cd VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins
git clone https://github.com/lun-4/obsidian-maid
cd obsidian-maid
npm i
npm run build # or 'npm run dev' for development
```

it's likely you will need to unbind Graph View in your settings, or bind
the Maid actions to different keys than the defaults.
